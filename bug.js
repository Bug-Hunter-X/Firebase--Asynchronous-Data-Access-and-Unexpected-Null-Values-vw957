The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot is fully populated.  This often happens when you're using asynchronous operations and trying to access data too early. For example:

```javascript
firebase.firestore().collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then((doc) => {
  console.log(doc.data().myField); // Error: myField might not exist yet
});
```
This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if `myField` is not yet available when this line executes.  Another subtle scenario involves nested data structures where accessing deeply nested fields requires checking for null or undefined at each level.

Consider also that network issues can cause intermittent failures, returning null snapshots even if data eventually exists.
